bar is the bar. 

ceo is the sound that will trigger 30 seconds before ceo takes the stage.

All of Bar is at same tempo as Corridor.  They should be locked.  Will this be a problem considering the length of the bar file?  It is a giant loop at 97bpm, but I want to make sure the bar and corridor remain locked for the duration of the night.

Below are more detailed notes for switching between speakers.  I didn't outline everything in the corridor.  Wasn't sure if you wanted me to list times for safe/unsafe on chords etc. -  or if you could take care of that?  Let me know.


Corridor

Bumps
0:07.151 - 0:07.337 safe to move to new speaker
0:17.020 - 0:17.298 safe to move to new speaker
0:26.935 - 0:27.190 safe to move to new speaker

Sonar
this one is annoying - call me for details...
starting at 1.082 it is unsafe for 1.082 and then safe for .154

0:00.000 - 0:00.927 NOT SAFE to move to new speaker
0:00.927 - 0:01.082 safe to move to new speaker
0:01.082 - 0:02.164 NOT SAFE to move to new speaker

Dings

global notes:
need master volume controls for:
corridor PAs
corridor pendants
sizzle/live
keynote
bar PA
bar Pendant

also need a master for all except keynote
plus a big button for pre-keynote behaviors (and for bringing stuff back after)

corridor: all (mono) sound files play locked together as a 12 bar loop. (except the things at the end of the corridoor which will phase at the end)

probably each chord will pan down the whole corridor (not sure of direction) - need to be ready to change panning behavior as makes sense on site (maybe from the center out)

chord/woosh is comprised of:
reverse cymbal sound
1 bass thing <-- this is probably only in PA speakers - may pan may not setup for both/either
2 medium chords(can be bounced together)
+ 2 high chords (can be bounced together
tape feedback -maybe slightly different pan behavior (following or opposite dir)

sonar thing:
pan (discretely) to new pendant speaker linearly in between each ping
maybe pings are opposite direction of chords

bumps / noisy kick thing:
need to pan (discretely) to new PA speakers in between bumps
maybe also opposite direction as well

end of corridor: (the last 3 pendants)
fairy dust (constant) - 3 separate mono files that will just loop in 2 chords that are 
jingles - same thing - 3 files
chirps - same - 3 files
high drone - single mono file, routed to last 3 pendants
lower drone - single mono file, routed to last 3 pendants
---------------------------------------------------------

feed / sizzle (potentially we might be asked to feed bar sounds to sizzle zone - be prepared for that possibility)
5 individual mono loops looping and play through all speakers - live-sizzle-soundname-PA

------------------------------------

bar - 45ish minute mono loops (locked to lobby)
8 (2 concentric circles)  and 4 pas

any pans need to kinda phase

pendant
phasing:
pings - discretely changes from pendant to pendant - can be randomly selected
pongs - same (opposite if ends up at the same pendant as a ping or ding)
dings - same (ok if ends up at the same pendant as pong or ping)
chirps - fast pan around all pendants - maybe a weave pattern (13,24,16,18,20,19)

locked long loops:
beatslap - same pan as chirps but a bit slower
stutter - same as beatslap
med blurb - same kinda pan thing as beatslap and stutter
high blurb - same
bells - pans across room left to right. maybe 13, 14+15, 16+17, 18+19, 20
cymbals - similar but pans north to south 16, 14-18, 13-20, 15-19, 17
blurb2 - same as beatslap
swish notes - 2 mono files each looping in half of the pendants (13,14,15 and 18,19,20)
high drone - similar to swish - channels specified in filename
underwater - beatslap pan pattern

pa
booms - mono and in all 4
kicks - mono and in all 4
basshits - "
bassbit - "
rhythmbass - "
strings - "
drums- "
porta - "
arppegio - "
shaker - "
quiet notes - "


bassline - 2 mono files each playing in 2 speakers
melody - "
dingbeat - "


keynote - 33-36 get feed/sizzle.. may need to pipe some other bar sounds over there

at 7:50 corridor, sizzle and bar sounds fade out and ppl have 10 minutes to be seated for keynote.
the only sound is the sizzle sounds that are in the keynote zone
