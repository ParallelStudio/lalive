global notes:
need master volume controls for:
corridor PAs
corridor pendants
sizzle/live
keynote
bar PA
bar Pendant

also need a master for all except keynote
plus a big button for pre-keynote behaviors (and for bringing stuff back after)

corridor: all (mono) sound files play locked together as a 12 bar loop. (except the things at the end of the corridoor which will phase at the end)

probably each chord will pan down the whole corridor (not sure of direction) - need to be ready to change panning behavior as makes sense on site (maybe from the center out)

chord/woosh is comprised of:
reverse cymbal sound
1 bass thing <-- this is probably only in PA speakers - may pan may not setup for both/either
2 medium chords(can be bounced together)
+ 2 high chords (can be bounced together
tape feedback -maybe slightly different pan behavior (following or opposite dir)

sonar thing:
pan (discretely) to new pendant speaker linearly in between each ping
maybe pings are opposite direction of chords

bumps / noisy kick thing:
need to pan (discretely) to new PA speakers in between bumps
maybe also opposite direction as well

end of corridor: (the last 3 pendants)
fairy dust (constant) - 3 separate mono files that will just loop in 2 chords that are 
jingles - same thing - 3 files
chirps - same - 3 files
high drone - single mono file, routed to last 3 pendants
lower drone - single mono file, routed to last 3 pendants
---------------------------------------------------------

feed / sizzle (potentially we might be asked to feed bar sounds to sizzle zone - be prepared for that possibility)
5 individual mono loops looping and play through all speakers - live-sizzle-soundname-PA

------------------------------------

bar - 45ish minute mono loops (locked to lobby)
8 (2 concentric circles)  and 4 pas

any pans need to kinda phase

pendant
phasing:
pings - discretely changes from pendant to pendant - can be randomly selected
pongs - same (opposite if ends up at the same pendant as a ping or ding)
dings - same (ok if ends up at the same pendant as pong or ping)
chirps - fast pan around all pendants - maybe a weave pattern (13,24,16,18,20,19)

locked long loops:
beatslap - same pan as chirps but a bit slower
stutter - same as beatslap
med blurb - same kinda pan thing as beatslap and stutter
high blurb - same
bells - pans across room left to right. maybe 13, 14+15, 16+17, 18+19, 20
cymbals - similar but pans north to south 16, 14-18, 13-20, 15-19, 17
blurb2 - same as beatslap
swish notes - 2 mono files each looping in half of the pendants (13,14,15 and 18,19,20)
high drone - similar to swish - channels specified in filename
underwater - beatslap pan pattern

pa
booms - mono and in all 4
kicks - mono and in all 4
basshits - "
bassbit - "
rhythmbass - "
strings - "
drums- "
porta - "
arppegio - "
shaker - "
quiet notes - "


bassline - 2 mono files each playing in 2 speakers
melody - "
dingbeat - "


keynote - 33-36 get feed/sizzle.. may need to pipe some other bar sounds over there

at 7:50 corridor, sizzle and bar sounds fade out and ppl have 10 minutes to be seated for keynote.
the only sound is the sizzle sounds that are in the keynote zone
